This package provides a library of standard\r\ncontrol system algorithms in the python programming environment.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nUsing pip\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nPip is a python packaging system. It can be installed on debian based\r\nlinux distros with the command::\r\n\r\n        sudo apt-get install pip\r\n\r\nPip can then be used to install python-control::\r\n\r\n        sudo pip install control\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Source\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nStandard python package installation::\r\n\r\n        python setup.py install\r\n\r\nTo see if things are working, you can run the script\r\nexamples/secord-matlab.py (using ipython -pylab).  It should generate a step\r\nresponse, Bode plot and Nyquist plot for a simple second order linear\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nYou can also run a set of unit tests to make sure that everything is working\r\ncorrectly.  After installation, run::\r\n\r\n        python runtests.py\r\n\r\nSlycot\r\n------\r\n\r\nRoutines from the Slycot wrapper are used for providing the\r\nfunctionality of several routines for state-space, transfer functions\r\nand robust control. Many parts of python-control will still work\r\nwithout slycot, but some functionality is limited or absent, and\r\ninstallation of Slycot is definitely recommended.  The Slycot wrapper\r\ncan be found at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jgoppert/Slycot\r\n\r\nand can be installed with::\r\n\r\n        sudo pip install slycot\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
